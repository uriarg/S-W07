This paper develops and estimates a stochastic dynamic general equilibrium (SDGE) model with sticky prices and wages for the Spanish Economy. The paper replicates the model used by Smets and Wouters (2007) and incorporates other features such as habit formation, costs of adjustment in capital accumulation and variable capacity utilization. It is estimated with Bayesian techniques using seven key macro-economic variables: GDP, consumption, investment, prices, real wages, employment and the nominal interest rate. The introduction of ten orthogonal structural shocks (including productivity, labor supply, investment, preference, cost-push and monetary policy shocks) allows for an empirical investigation of the effects of such shocks and of their contribution to business cycle fluctuations in the economy. Using the estimated model, the paper also analyses the driving forces of the economy and its reactions within the sample years estimated. Finally, I will contrast the results obtained with another economy.
